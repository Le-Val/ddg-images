# ddg-images
Duckduckgo images wrapper for Deno


### Usage

```ts
import { search, SafetyLevels } from "https://deno.land/x/ddgimages@v1.1.1/mod.ts"

// strict by default
const results = await search("hello world")

console.log(results[0])

```

as simple as that, I only use this as a dependency for my bot


### btw check out a [node version](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ddgimages-node)
